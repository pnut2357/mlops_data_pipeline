# MLOps Feature Pipeline Template (Use Case: Stock Prediction)
## Overview
This repository provides a standardized MLOps template for tackling common machine learning problems. Leveraging Airflow, Astronomer, and Cloud Composer, this template streamlines the entire ML lifecycle, from feature engineering to model monitoring.
The MLOps template architecture is proposed, and the use case of the current pipeline is stock prediction across Moving Average, ARIMA, and LSTM models.

## MLOps Pipeline Architecture

<br>

This template implements a robust MLOps pipeline encompassing the following stages:

1. **Feature Engineering:**  Transforms raw data into suitable model input using techniques like ETL, data wrangling, feature engineering, labeling, data balancing, imputation, normalization, and regularization. Processed features are stored in a Feature Store for reusability.

2. **Model Training:** Automates hyperparameter tuning, model training, and model evaluation using various algorithms. Trained models are registered in a Model Registry.

3. **Model Deployment:** Deploys trained models for inference serving, utilizing containerization (e.g., Kubernetes) and API gateways.

4. **Inferencing/Serving:**  Handles incoming inference requests, preprocesses data, invokes the deployed model, and returns predictions.

5. **Monitoring:**  Continuously monitors model performance, data quality, and data drift to ensure model reliability and identify potential issues.

6. **Feedback Loop:**  Integrates model analysis and data analysis to inform further experimentation and model improvement.  Source code management and CI/CD pipelines automate model building, testing, and deployment.

## Model Performance Monitoring
This project includes a robust model monitoring solution built using BigQuery and Vertex AI.  This solution goes beyond basic monitoring by providing enhanced flexibility and control over data drift and data skew detection.

### **Key Features:**

* **Data Drift Detection:**  Identifies significant divergence between the distribution of training data and current inference data.
* **Data Skew Detection:**  Highlights shifts in the distribution of inference data over time, even if it remains similar to the training data.
* **Scalable and Robust:** Leverages BigQuery's analytical capabilities and Vertex AI's infrastructure for efficient and reliable monitoring.
* **Comprehensive Reporting:** Generates an HTML report visualizing drift and skew metrics, clearly indicating affected columns and the magnitude of changes.
* **Integrated Monitoring:**  Provides an option to integrate with Google Cloud Logging/Prometheus and Grafana for visualizing drift/skew metrics beyond the HTML report via a Vertex AI pipeline.

### **Pipeline Components:**

* **Data Ingestion:**  Retrieves training and inference data from BigQuery.
* **Data Analysis:**  Uses custom BigQuery SQL and potentially custom Python functions to perform drift and skew analysis.
* **Report Generation:** Creates an HTML report summarizing the findings.
* **Alerting:** Uses Google Cloud Logging/Prometheus and Grafana to provide alerts based on predefined thresholds.
